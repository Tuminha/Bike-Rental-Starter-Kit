## üìä Data Engineering Process

### Phase 1: Data Exploration
**Objective**: Understand data structure and quality issues

**Key Findings**:
- **247,584 total bike trips** across 12 months (2016)
- **366 weather records** with daily granularity
- **102 unique stations** in Jersey City
- **Data quality issues**: Missing birth year (7.67%), extreme trip durations (some > 100 days)

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- Data loading and inspection with pandas
- Missing value analysis and data profiling
- Statistical analysis and outlier detection

### Phase 2: Data Cleaning & Validation
**Objective**: Prepare clean, analytics-ready datasets

**Cleaning Decisions**:
- **Trip Duration Filtering**: 60 seconds to 24 hours (removed 93 extreme outliers)
- **Missing Data Handling**: 
  - Birth Year: Filled with mean value (preserves demographic analysis)
  - User Type: Dropped rows (0.15% loss acceptable)
  - Weather: Dropped completely missing columns (PGTM, TSUN)
- **Derived Features**: Day of week, hour, age, weather categories

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- Strategic data cleaning decisions
- Outlier detection and handling
- Feature engineering for analytics
- Data validation and quality assurance

### Phase 3: Database Schema Design
**Objective**: Design normalized, scalable database structure

**Schema Design**:
- **3 normalized tables** (3NF compliance)
- **Proper relationships**: Foreign keys between rides, stations, and weather
- **Strategic indexing**: 6 indexes for analytics performance
- **Data types**: Appropriate PostgreSQL types for each field

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- Database normalization principles
- Entity-relationship modeling
- Performance optimization through indexing
- SQL DDL design

### Phase 4: Database Implementation
**Objective**: Implement production-ready PostgreSQL database

**Implementation Results**:
- **PostgreSQL 15** database successfully created
- **247,111 rides** loaded with batch processing
- **102 stations** extracted and normalized
- **366 weather records** with proper relationships
- **6 performance indexes** created and optimized

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- PostgreSQL database administration
- ETL pipeline implementation
- Batch data loading for performance
- Database optimization (ANALYZE/VACUUM)

### Phase 5: Analytics Views
**Objective**: Create business intelligence capabilities

**Analytics Views Created**:
1. **daily_weather_rides**: Weather-ridership correlation analysis
2. **hourly_ridership_patterns**: Peak time identification
3. **weekly_ridership_patterns**: Day-of-week usage patterns
4. **station_utilization**: Station performance metrics
5. **monthly_kpi_summary**: Business performance tracking
6. **weather_impact_analysis**: Weather sensitivity analysis

**Technical Skills Demonstrated**:
- Advanced SQL query writing
- Complex JOIN operations
- Aggregation and window functions
- Business intelligence design

## üìà Business Insights & Recommendations

### Key Findings

#### 1. Weather Impact on Ridership
- **Temperature Correlation**: Strong positive correlation between temperature and ridership
- **Precipitation Impact**: Rain significantly reduces bike usage
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Peak usage in summer months (June-August)

#### 2. Usage Patterns
- **Peak Hours**: 8-9 AM and 5-6 PM (commute times)
- **Weekly Patterns**: Higher usage on weekdays vs weekends
- **User Demographics**: 93.7% subscribers vs 6.3% customers

#### 3. Station Utilization
- **High-Traffic Stations**: Grove St PATH, Hamilton Park, Van Vorst Park
- **Geographic Distribution**: Stations near transit hubs show highest usage
- **Utilization Efficiency**: Top 10 stations handle 40% of all rides

### Business Recommendations

#### Operational Optimization
1. **Weather-Based Operations**: Increase bike availability on warm, dry days
2. **Peak Hour Management**: Deploy additional bikes during commute hours
3. **Station Optimization**: Focus maintenance on high-traffic stations

#### Strategic Planning
1. **Seasonal Staffing**: Increase operations staff during summer months
2. **Customer Acquisition**: Target casual riders with weather-based promotions
3. **Expansion Planning**: Use station utilization data for new location decisions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Database Design Decisions

#### Normalization Strategy
**Decision**: Implemented 3NF (Third Normal Form)
**Rationale**: Eliminates data duplication, ensures data integrity, enables efficient updates

#### Indexing Strategy
**Decision**: Created 6 strategic indexes
**Rationale**: Optimizes common analytics queries (date ranges, station analysis, user segmentation)

#### Data Type Choices
**Decision**: Used appropriate PostgreSQL types (TIMESTAMP, DECIMAL, INTEGER)
**Rationale**: Ensures data accuracy, enables proper sorting and filtering

### Data Cleaning Decisions

#### Trip Duration Filtering
**Decision**: Filtered trips between 60 seconds and 24 hours
**Rationale**: Removes system errors while preserving legitimate usage patterns

#### Missing Data Handling
**Decision**: Mean imputation for birth year, row deletion for user type
**Rationale**: Preserves demographic analysis while maintaining data quality
